    "# PyCity Schools Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "* In this analysis, we evaluate math and reading scores of the schools in the sampled district and then group them according to school size, per student budget, and school type. Many confounding factors involving the schools' student and teacher populations have not been controlled for, so it is prudent to not make sweeping conclusions for this analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "* That being said, larger schools (2000-5000 students), public schools (as opposed to charter), and high funding schools ($645-$680) performed considerably worse than other groupings, with an overall passing rate in the 53-58% range for each category. Small schools, charter schools, and schools with funding below $580 achieved overall passing percentages right around 90%. \n",
    "\n",
    "* One relatively safe conclusion from this analysis is that a higher rate of funding is not adequate in fixing a school struggling with testing metrics. While more funding would probably not hurt testing scores as a quick glance at our analysis would suggest, other factors are likely more relevant contributors to testing scores assuming the school is fully funded.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The impact of school size on testing scores should also be investigated further. Again, there are too many confounding factors to conclude that smaller schools are automatically preferable to larger schools. However, unlike our negative correlation observed with school funding and test scores, there are reasons that smaller schools may make for a better learning environment than very large schools that make the phenomenon worth investigating in detail. \n",
